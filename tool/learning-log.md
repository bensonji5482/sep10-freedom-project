# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Aframe (For Freedom Project)**

---

### 3/4/2025:
* I used aframe for my freedom project and I learned some things about aframe.

#### Things I learned
* I learned that I can create shapes as long as it has the right name to it such as instead of `pyramid` use `tetrahedron` because it is more like a triangular prism.
* I learned that it is a simulation where you can move around in making it a virtual reality for creations that you want to use.
* The numbers that are in the code controls a specifc guideline. Such as the 1st number controls the direction left and right, the second controls up and down while the last goes backwards.

```language
<a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
<a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="0.75" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
<a-cylinder position="0 0.75 -5" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
<a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="99" height="99" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
```
* The first four were original shapes of the simulation while I modified the numbers. I ended up learning
