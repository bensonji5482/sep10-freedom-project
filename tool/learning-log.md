# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Aframe (For Freedom Project)**

---

### 3/4/2025:
* I used aframe for my freedom project and I learned some things about aframe.

#### Things I learned
* I learned that I can create shapes as long as it has the right name to it such as instead of `pyramid` use `tetrahedron` because it is more like a triangular prism.
* I learned that it is a simulation where you can move around in making it a virtual reality for creations that you want to use.
* The numbers that are in the code controls a specifc guideline. Such as the 1st number controls the direction left and right, the second controls up and down while the last goes backwards.

```language
<a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
<a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="0.75" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
<a-cylinder position="0 0.75 -5" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
<a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="99" height="99" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
/* Split Here */
<a-tetrahedron position="-5 0.5 -7" rotaion="0 45 0" height="2" color="red"></a-tetrahedron>
<a-cone position="2 0.5 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="green"></a-cone>
<a-sky color="lightblue"></a-sky>
```
* The first four were original shapes of the simulation while I modified the numbers. I ended up learning 2 new shapes for the simulation and learned how to change sky color with it already being there at the start.

### 3/10/25:
#### Found a source to help me with Aframe
* I found a source that helps me with aframe and I found the source because I wanted shapes and I searched `all shapes in aframe` on google and I found this [github file](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/geometry.md) that had everything about the most or all the components of Aframe and that helped me with shapes because I ended up learning more shapes in aframe which ma come in handy in the future.
```langauge
<a-torus position="1 3 -4" radius="0.75" height="0.5" color="cyan"></a-torus>
<a-octahedron position="3 1 -7" radius="0.75" height="1.5" color="green"></a-octahedron>
```
* I learned new shapes such as the `torus` which is a 3d verison of a `ring` and a `octahedron` which is a 3d verison of a `diamond` and I plan to use most of the shapes that I can find it the `[github file]`(https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/geometry.md) and to study the components on days that I have to do the freedom project specifically speaking as `Freedom Mondays.`
