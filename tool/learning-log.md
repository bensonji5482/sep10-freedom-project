### 3/4/2025:
* I used aframe for my freedom project and I learned some things about aframe.

#### Things I learned
* I learned that I can create shapes as long as it has the right name to it such as instead of `pyramid` use `tetrahedron` because it is more like a triangular prism.
* I learned that it is a simulation where you can move around in making it a virtual reality for creations that you want to use.
* The numbers that are in the code controls a specifc guideline.
