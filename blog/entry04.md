## Tool Chosen
The tool that I chose is AFrame and the way I tinkered with it is by testing what the code does and how it changes the simulation after I test the simulation by using `http-server` in my IDE as I thinkered the AFrame code there. I learned some things about AFrame which I learned can help support me later on as I move forward in class.
