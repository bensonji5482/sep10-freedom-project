## Content about my topic (chess)
Chess, a topic I decided to write about, is a game played by many people around the world as the game interested them for many centuries and eons. People have played many times and decided to make **sofware and hardware** to improve the game. It all started when **I used google to find software and hardware** made by people in the past all the way up to this time period of 2024. I first searched `hardware in chess` to find this webiste called [`Computer Chess-Wikapedia`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_chess) and it is about how the computer operated when it was created and tested to make it eligible over the years of creating computers capable of playing chess. With the same search as before (`hardware in chess`), I looked into the website called [`Game-Changing Technologies Have Transformed Chess`](https://curve.mit.edu/game-changing-technologies-transformed-chess-is-your-business-next), this webiste is mainly about how computers can provide education to help kids and adults learn and use skill to play the game. It is also about how people can also have a computer version of themselves having some of their human capabilities and some computer abilities put into it. The last website I looked into is called [History of chess engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chess_engines). This website is mainly about the same things as the first website and the construction of computer chess.
