## Content about my topic (chess)
Chess, a topic I decided to write about, is a game played by many people around the world as the game interested them for many centuries and eons. People have played many times and decided to make **sofware and hardware** to improve the game. It all started when **I used google to find software and hardware** made by people in the past all the way up to this time period of 2024. I first searched `hardware in chess` to find this webiste called [`Computer Chess-Wikapedia`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_chess) and it is about how the computer operated when it was created and tested to make it eligible over the years of creating computers capable of playing chess. With the same search as before (`hardware in chess`), I looked into the website called [`Game-Changing Technologies Have Transformed Chess`](https://curve.mit.edu/game-changing-technologies-transformed-chess-is-your-business-next), this webiste is mainly about how computers can provide education to help kids and adults learn and use skill to play the game. It is also about how people can also have a computer version of themselves having some of their human capabilities and some computer abilities put into it. The last website I looked into is called [`History of chess engines`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chess_engines). This website is mainly about the same things as the first website and the construction of computer chess.

## EDP (Engineering Design Process)
I am currently on the second (`Research the problem`) and third (`Brainstorm possible solutions`) stage of the process. By researching the problem I can find what needs to be put into the FP (`Freedom Project`). I put what I need to put into the freedom project along with notes to design and make my freedom project. I am still trying to find useful things to put in the freedom project to make things look more colorful and I figured out my pros and cons for the topic of chess.

## Skills I learned
I learned how to see what a useful website is. Examples can be websites that has `.org`, `.edu`, uses `https` in website links and `no pop-up ads` in the website. I learned how to use `time mangagement` in a way by taking things I get from website I searched and simplified them to make them shorter and more understandable. Use notes **`wisely`** is something else I learned by applying things that I took notes of for HTML and CSS during class to decide what would be the way I use those skills.
