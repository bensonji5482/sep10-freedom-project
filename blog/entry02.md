## Content about my topic (chess)
Chess is a game played by many people around the world as the game interested them for many centuries and eons. People have played many times and decided to make **sofware and hardware** to improve the game. It all started when **I used google to find software and hardware** made by people in the past all the way up to this time period of 2024. I first searched `hardware in chess` to find this webiste called [Computer Chess-Wikapedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_chess) and it is about how it was first created and tested amongst humans over the years.
