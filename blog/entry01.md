## Topic
##### I chose the topic of chess. I chose this because there are many questions to how was the game even formed, how did it end up being so popular, how can people or technology play these games, how can people learn from these board games. The [strategy](https://www.chess.com/articles/strategy) article and the [opening theory](https://www.chess.com/articles/opening-theory) article on chess.com helps you learn more from mistakes that people do and help enhance your thinking much more than you usually do. One of the other idea I had was checkers and it is similar to chess except there is not many strategies and the game is easy to play.

## EDP (Engineering Design Process)
##### For the engineering design process I am currently between the first and the second stage of the process as I am trying to figure out how I am going to outline my project and how I can research the topic to the best of my ability to work on the Freedom Project.

## Skills
##### The skill that people can learn from studying strategies in chess may improve your growth + mindset and embracing failiure. There is also the skill of creativity when playing chess or providing outside of school / social life. Improving growth + mindset helps you embrace failiure when you lose so you can improve on working startegies and creativity to make plays that makes the game chess.
