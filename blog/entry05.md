## What I did over the past few Freedom Project Days
During these last few days on the freedom project days, I started using a tool called Aframe for making designs on my topic of chess for the officail freedom project. They way I tinkered with it is that I made chessboards with pieces on it such as, pawns, rooks, knight, bishops, queen and a king on my board that I made. I learned many things from making the chessboard and the pieces for my topic of chess. I learned how to adjust the shape size with certain components by looking at [This thing](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/docs/components/geometry.md).

## How I progressed through Aframe
I made big chessboards with the things provided in geometry.md folder of the link above and I learned new things about the shapes as I makde the board for example, when I didn't know how to make a sphere smaller and I was always trying to use the `width` property to make the sphere smaller but it didn't work. When I went to the geometry.md folder of the link above I found a section that was related to shperes and I saw that there are different components for the parts of the sphere with an example of a sphere code example ana=d I saw that there is a `radius` property which I used to make the sphere smaller. It started as `width="0.5"` which obviously didn't work to the working, `radius="0.5"` as I also managed to learn shape pairings that worked together to make the chess pieces such as using 2 cones and a sphere for a bishop or 2 cones a cylinder and a sphere to make a queen etc.

## Skills I learned throughout the process
