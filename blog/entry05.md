## What I did over the past few Freedom Project Days
During these last few days on the freedom project days, I started using a tool called Aframe for making designs on my topic of chess for the officail freedom project. They way I tinkered with it is that I made chessboards with pieces on it such as, pawns, rooks, knight, bishops, queen and a king on my board that I made. I learned many things from making the chessboard and the pieces for my topic of chess.
