## FP Website
I `finished` my website just on this week and I used as many thing as I learned to make my website solely about chess, I also added what I tinkered with my tool which was Aframe into my website as well as making edits to whatever I need when I have the time to do it and it was all thanks to my teacher.

## EDP 
I am currently on the process where I see my website and use strategeies to look and see what I have to fix, add, or change to the webiste to make it more enagaing or better to see and also around the stage where I can be able to communicate with the results as a masterpiece that I created. One example of that is how there was place holders boxes and it look somewhat strange so I changed it into a box to not let the cursor show it is loading something.

## Skills
I learned how to `use thoughts and strategies` to fix my webiste which is a important skill because without strategies, you won't be able to fix anything. Also alongside that, `thinking outside the box` may also count as one because stratgeies that are used are always what you can think outside of what you would normally do which is what I usually do anyway.
