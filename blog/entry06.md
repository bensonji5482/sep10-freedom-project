## FP Website
I finished my website just on this week and I used as many thing as I learned to make my website solely about chess, I also added what I tinkered with my tool which was Aframe into my website as well as making edits to whatever I need when I have the time to do it and it was all thanks to my teacher.

## EDP 
I am currently on the process where I see my website and see what I have to fix, add, or change to the webiste to make it more enagaing or better to see and also around the stage where I can be able to communicate witn the results as a masterpiece that I created.
