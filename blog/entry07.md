## Context
After I finished my webiste which was called `Chess World` as shown [here](bensonji5482.github.io/sep10-freedom-project)

## Takeaways from in class presentations
So one takeaway that I have from doing in-class presentations was that ...
* I needed more eye contact (I didn't look up once)
* Having a better hook (Wasn't engaging enough)
* Make presentation time longer (Too short)
