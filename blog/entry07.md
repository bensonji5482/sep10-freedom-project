## Context
After I finished my webiste which was called `Chess World` as shown [here](https://bensonji5482.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) in which that was my website. Then I had to do a in-class presentation with [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1veKDf-8Cu95iq0JEvdt3tlMJCiqVcZXJZViqBhBQBec/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) and then do a elevator pitch that takes less than one minute including to try and show off the website that I made throughout the course of my SEP class. This elevator pitch was created in my notes during class time and then made into a paragraph which was `My project is called 'Chess World'. This is a website built to show how chess builds focus, and thoughts through strategy and decision-making. “What if a game could develop your mind?” This explores how chess teaches life skills beyond the board. I used various types of codes to create a clean, interactive site that’s easy to navigate. It includes sections like the introduction, some unique things about chess, past & future innovations and lastly the FAQ. This project is personal to me because chess has helped me grow mentally, and I wanted to show others how powerful thinking can be. In the end, the message is simple: chess isn’t just a game — it’s a tool for real-life growth.` One advice that my teacher then told me was that I could have at least described my future innovations a bit but I ended up doing the elevator pitch (and have already added a bit to it).

## Takeaways from in class presentations
So some takeaways that I have from doing the in-class presentations was that ...
* I needed more eye contact (I didn't look up once)
* Have a better hook (Wasn't engaging enough)
* To make presentation time longer (Too short)

## Takeaways from SEP-Expo presentations
After the in-class presentations that I had I went on to do the elevator pitch during the SEP Expo whcih I also have some takeaways on which is ...
* Since I was so nervous, I didn't have that much of a good impression on the people I presented to (which means I have to try to not be nervous next time)
* I could have also tried to show off my website more as the website is the most crucial thing to be using in expos like this one

## Skills
The skills that I can develop which will be `to be better at presentations` because I wasn't so good when I presented and these presentations can help me do better in the future when I do more presentations, I can also develop the skill of `time management` because the presentation that I did during class was too short as said by myself and the teacher.
