## Content about my topic (chess)
Chess is a game played for many years as people have many experience with it. I am trying to **find** what `inventions exists today`, ``what may exist in the future`` and what would change about the world of chess as years and days progress on. I started to write about `things that exist today` and what `things will exist in the future` as well as what people do in the future. I learned that as people make more and more technologies for chess, they tend to improve over time and as time passes people make more and more technologies that defy our imagination and our processes.

## EDP (Engineering Design Process)
What I have been `starting to do` about chess is to `make different sections` for outling the freedom project that I am trying to make. I set it up by what my topic is, `technologies that exists in the modern day` which is part A, `technologies that might exist in the near future` as time rolls around and I can `maybe put a conclusion` or basically an ending to all the content. The stage that I am on is the `Plan the most promising solution` because I am currently `oulining` what I am going to put on my freedom project.

## Skills I learned
I learned how to `organize my notes` in such a way that I can almost copy and paste it onto my website insetad to just thinking it out. I also learned `time management` because with taking notes and organizing it, it `saves me the time` to think about what to put on the website instead of thinking about it considering it is a year long project.
