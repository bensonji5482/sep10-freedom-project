| Bah  | Color scheme and organization are well done  | You should try inserting the future ideas that you have brainstormed for part B instead of the placeholder text!
| Leo  |  I like how you add a A-frame model | I think you should add different bootstrap elements cause theres alot of cards.
| Xin Yu  | I ike how your overall design of your website is very fanshionable and very organized  | I think you should make it so that your navbar is fixed top, because just in case someone wants to go back to a section they don't have to scroll all the way to the top for the navbar. I think fixed top navbar would make an much easier time both for the user for navigating stuffs.
| Jehan  |  I like the oganization of your website, and how you were able to use cards to section off each individual section, I also like the in-depth reseraech that you made on your topic, showing that you havev a lot of knowledge about it.  | Something that I believe that you can work on is consdensing the information on some parts in order to keep the viewers attention. I also believe that you can use different bootstrap elemetns, that can help organize your website.
