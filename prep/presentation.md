# Presentation Plan

## Hook:
* Imagine a game that not only sharpens your mind but evolves with it—welcome to chess in the digital age. This project explores how the timeless game of strategy has adapted to modern technology, enhancing its impact on cognitive development and global reach.

## Product:
* The website is designed to teach others about the fundamentals of chess, its unique strategies, and the digital advancements that continue to shape the game.

* Features:
Clear, easy-to-navigate layout
Custom styling and design
Interactive elements that make learning engaging

* Tools Used:
HTML & CSS for structure and design
Bootstrap for interactivity
GitHub Pages for deployment

## Process:
* This was mainly developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and using research on many chess platforms and innovations to provide a good learning experience.
* I will use some of my aframe code snippets to show the process as well as some of the website's code.

## Conclusion:
* What I Learned:
Web Development Skills: I improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, especially how to structure a site and style it cleanly.
Problem-Solving: I faced challenges with layout and responsiveness, and I learned how to debug issues using developer tools.
Project Planning: I learned how to break a big idea into smaller steps and stay organized during the building process.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
