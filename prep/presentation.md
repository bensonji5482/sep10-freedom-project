# Presentation Plan

## Hook:
* What if there is a game that can devlop you mindset to a larger degree, well it would be the game of chess. This project explores the enduring appeal of chess and its evolution in the digital age.

## Product:
* The website is designed to teach others about the fundamentals of chess, its unique strategies, and the technological advancements that continue to shape the game.

## Process:
* This was mainly developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, incorporating research on various chess platforms and innovations to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

## Conclusion:
* Through creating "Chess World," I discovered how coding can bring the rich history and complexity of chess to life online, enhancing both my technical skills and appreciation for the game.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
